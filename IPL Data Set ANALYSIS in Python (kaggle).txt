#There are two data files 1.matches & 2.deliveries
#we will analyse the data and answer few questions such as 
#1.number of teams?
#2.number of matches?
#3.which team won by maximum Runs?
#4.which team won by maximum wickets?
#5.which IPL team is more successful?


#we will first load the libraries which are important for analysis
import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #visualization
import seaborn as sns # visualization


#now we will read the csv data set

IPL = pd.read_csv('../input/matches.csv')
IPL



#we will perform some basic operation on the dataframe
#1. head() which gives the first 5 rows of the dataframe
IPL.head()
#2. If we want to read only first two rows of dataframe the we can use
IPL.head(2)



#2.we will use tail() which gives last fir rows of the dataframe
IPL.tail()
# if we want to see only last two rows then we can write as 
IPL.tail(2)



# now we will get the number of rows and columns in the dataset
IPL.shape


#now we will get the summary statistics 
IPL.describe()
#Nan here is null value which can be replaced


#now we will get the variables data types from the data set
IPL.info()


#now we will solve the actual questions stated above at the top.
#1. we will find the number of teams 
IPL['team1'].unique()

#in this dataset we have two teams column which have played with other once. so we can use IPL['team'].unique as well.



#2. we will find the number of matches from the dataset?
IPL['id'].max()


#3. which team won by maximum runs?
#for this we will iloc operation which takes the index value and returns the row and we will use the max function to get this on the id column.
IPL.iloc[IPL['win_by_runs'].idxmax()]['winner']


#4. now we will find which team won by maximum wickets?
#we can use the same above code of #3 and just replace win_by_runs with the wickets column.
IPL.iloc[IPL['win_by_wickets'].idxmax()]['winner']




#5. now we will find which Ipl team is most successfull. we will answer it by visualization
#sns.countplot(y='winner', data = matches)
#plt.show
data = IPL.winner.value_counts()
sns.barplot(y = data.index, x = data, orient='h')
